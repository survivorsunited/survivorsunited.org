[transfer]
# The method clients should use in transfering their modlist to the server.
# "data" will have clients send the entirety of each file in their modlist. This is the most secure.
# "name" will have clients send the name of each file in their modlist. This is significantly faster.
# Use "name" if you are using large modpacks to make login times reasonable.
# Accepted types: "data", "name"
method = "data"

[validation]
# The method to check client's mod list.
# If you prefer blacklisting/whitelisting certain mods from being used, use "individual".
# If you prefer ensuring client's have a modpack installed, use "group".
# Accepted types: "individual", "group"
