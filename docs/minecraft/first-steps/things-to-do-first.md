# Things to Do First Before You Play

Before you start your adventure on our Minecraft server, there are a few important steps you should take to get the most out of your experience.

## Create a Party

The Open Parties and Claims mod allows you to form groups with other players. **Creating a party will allow you to make claims to land so that you can protect your creations from unwanted mishaps.**

This server uses the mod "Open Parties and Claims" - you can find plenty of information on this if you wish.

### Creating a New Party

Use the following command to create a new party:

```bash
/openpac-parties create
```

This will initiate a new party that you can invite other players to join.

### Inviting Players

To invite other players to your party, use:

```bash
/openpac-parties member invite <player_name>
```

Replace `<player_name>` with the actual username of the player you want to invite.

> **Note**: You can configure what your party and members can do, but leave this for later. Focus on the first steps for now - you can visit this when you're ready.

## Claiming Land

Land claiming helps protect your builds and resources from griefing. You can manage claims through:

You can view and edit your claims on the Xaero's Map screen `M`, by right-clicking on the map or dragging with the right mouse button to make a selection, then selecting Claim.

## Request Admin Alliance

**Only when you have a party can you be made an ally.** Once you have a party, you can use it to ally with our server administrators and also ally your friends.

### Admin Alliance Benefits

Requesting an alliance with our server administrators will:

- **Grant access to shared resources** - You'll be able to use community infrastructure
- **Provide access to shared structures** - Use community builds and facilities
- **Enable collaboration** - Work together with other allied players
- **Unlock trading opportunities** - Access the trading hall and community resources

### How to Request Alliance

Contact our server administrators through:
- **Discord**: Join our ${DISCORD_LOBBY} and message an admin
- **In-game**: Use the chat to request alliance with online admins

### Friend Alliances

Once you have a party, you can also:
- **Ally your friends** - Add them to your party for collaborative building
- **Share resources** - Work together on projects and share materials
- **Protect shared builds** - Claim land together for group projects

Once you're allied, you'll have access to all the shared resources and structures that make our community thrive!
