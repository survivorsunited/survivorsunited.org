## How to Use Community Farms

### General Guidelines

1. **Share Resources**: Don't monopolize farms - take what you need and let others use them
2. **Maintain Farms**: Help repair and maintain farms when needed
3. **Report Issues**: Let the community know if a farm is broken or needs attention
4. **Be Respectful**: Don't grief or destroy farm structures

### Farm Etiquette

- **AFK Item Handling**: If you are AFK, you can either leave the items at the farm or move them to Item Vault
- **Don't AFK for Extended Periods**: Let others use the farms too
- **Clean Up**: Don't leave items scattered around farms
- **Ask Questions**: If you're unsure how to use a farm, ask in Discord
- **Contribute**: Help build new farms or improve existing ones

### Waypoints

Waypoints are scattered across the world. You will need to make your way to districts by foot for the first time. Ask someone to help you navigate to where you need to go. Once you've discovered the locations, you can use the waypoint system in your map mods to navigate between farms:
