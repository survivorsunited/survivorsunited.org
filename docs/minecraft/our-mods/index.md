# Our Mods

Survivors United maintains a lightweight suite of custom Minecraft mods to close gameplay gaps that larger modpacks often miss. These projects are open source, easy to install, and designed to complement the community’s modpack without introducing heavy dependencies.

Each mod below links to its GitHub repository for source code, issues, and releases. Install them alongside the standard Survivors United modpack to extend quality-of-life features for all players.

## Included Mods

- [`mods-su-compostables`](./mods-su-compostables.md)
- [`mods-su-craftable-name-tag`](./mods-su-craftable-name-tag.md)
