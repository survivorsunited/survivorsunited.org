This page is the source of truth for Survivors United Hytale mods.

Hytale emphasizes **server-side modding**, so players typically do **not** need to install client mods to join our server. The server distributes new content and mechanics automatically.

## Approved Mods

Below is the current list of mods enabled on the Hytale server.  
If a project page is not live on CurseForge yet, the link points to a CurseForge search for that mod name.
